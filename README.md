# Pixel-Hero

A turn-based battle game made for my Computer Science group project in senior high school in 2021.

This project was coded in Java SE 8, using the NetBeans IDE.

The game's battle system is based on the battle mechanics featured in the Pok√©mon video game series and in the video game, Persona 4.

### Note:

The original version of this project would play songs from the Persona 4 Golden (Steam) Digital Deluxe Soundtrack that I owned, however this has been removed due to copyright. As a result, the code for playing music has been commented out.

# How to Run

Make sure that you have Java installed in your system. Download the dist folder and run the jar file to play the game.

# Features & Mechanics

## **3 Different Enemies**
  * Choose to fight: Knight, Ragnarok, or Fire Demon.
  * Each opponent comes with their own difficulty.
  * Each comes with their own strengths and weaknesses.
  * Each has their own unique AI: attack behaviour, and combat awareness.

## **Dynamic Battle System**
  * Gain an advantage by landing critical hits or weaknesses: The enemy will get downed, letting the player gain an additional turn. However, the same can be done to the player by the oppenent.

## **Elemental Skills, Buffs, & Items**
  * Use elemental skills to attack an ememy's weakness and gain the advantage.
  * Cast buffs to boost your stats (i.e. attack power, defense level, and evade level) temporarily.
  * Use consumable items to recover health, or to receive temporary element immunity.
